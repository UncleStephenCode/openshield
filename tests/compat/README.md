# Linux compatibility matrices

The compatibility suite separates four different kinds of evidence. A pass in
one layer must not be interpreted as a pass in another.

| Layer | What it establishes | What it does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| image manifest | a named container image was available from its registry at the time of the check | binary compatibility or runtime support |
| static musl smoke | both binaries can start and print `--version` in the image's userspace | init boot, libc integration, firewall tools, kernel features, NFQUEUE, or policy correctness |
| cross-target `cargo check` | the workspace type-checks for an installed Rust target standard library | linking, execution, hardware behavior, kernel ABI, or packaging |
| init parser/supervisor fixture | staged files, selected parsers, lifecycle hooks, and group helper behave in isolated fixtures | a real boot or real firewall policy |

The real Learning-to-Enforcing firewall workflow is a separate end-to-end test.

## Release validation versus compatibility research

The release pipeline has its own authoritative matrix:
[`packaging/ci/release-matrix.json`](../../packaging/ci/release-matrix.json).
It defines 43 binary rows and 43 matching package rows. Its runtime submatrix
installs 19 package variants in exactly 37 distribution/userspace and
OCI-platform rows: 16 `amd64`, 15 `arm64`, and 6 `386`. Every runtime row is
expanded into both firewall backends, producing 74 firewall E2E jobs. The other
24 package variants account for 49 of the 86 declared distribution/platform
mappings; they are build-only and have no package-install or firewall evidence.
The release dependency graph is:

```text
Validation
    -> Quality Gate
    -> Binaries
    -> Packages
    -> Install Matrix
    -> Container Tests
    -> Firewall E2E
    -> Performance Smoke
    -> Release Evidence
    -> Publish
```

The complete policy, architecture evidence levels, and publication boundary are
documented in [the release CI guide](../../.github/README-CI.md). Compilation is
allowed only after Validation and the Quality Gate. Publication is allowed only
after the evidence stage has reconciled every required matrix row and release
asset.

The single openSUSE Tumbleweed `linux/amd64` performance smoke begins only after
the entire functional E2E matrix succeeds. It is a bounded release regression
gate and does not add architecture or distribution support evidence to this
compatibility matrix.

The 37 runtime rows cover Debian 12/13, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04/26.04, Fedora 43/44,
Rocky Linux 9/10, AlmaLinux 9/10, openSUSE Leap 16.0, Tumbleweed, Alpine
3.23/3.24, and Arch Linux on `amd64`, `arm64`, and, where published by the
image, `386`. A family/architecture binary and package may be built once, but
installation, container testing, and both backend results remain separate for
every selected distribution/platform row. ARMv5/6/7, `ppc64le`, `riscv64`,
and `s390x` remain build targets only.

This release matrix and the 60-row research matrix below serve different
purposes. Passing the broad compatibility smoke does not add a release row, and
removing an archived research image does not change the package-support
contract. Do not derive release claims from `distros.tsv`.

## Distribution image matrix

`distros.tsv` contains exactly 60 rows across Debian/Ubuntu, Alpine, Fedora,
Rocky, AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream, Oracle Linux, openSUSE, Amazon Linux, Arch,
Gentoo, Void, Devuan, and Artix. Rows intentionally include maintained,
rolling, legacy, and archived releases spanning approximately the preceding ten
years. The lifecycle column describes the image row; it is not a project support
commitment.

Validate matrix syntax and row count without Docker:

```console
scripts/test-distro-matrix.sh validate
```

Check registry manifests:

```console
scripts/test-distro-matrix.sh manifests
```

Run a smoke matrix using a directory that contains statically linked musl
`openshield-daemon` and `openshield-tui` binaries:

```console
scripts/test-distro-matrix.sh smoke /absolute/musl/release-directory
```

`smoke` requires a local Unix-socket Docker endpoint, disables networking in
each test container, mounts binaries read-only, makes the root filesystem
read-only, drops all capabilities, and enables `no-new-privileges`. It does not
remove images, which avoids racing with other local Docker users. `smoke-clean`
remains as a deprecated, non-destructive alias for `smoke`. The completed matrix
run against the final static-PIE artifacts reported `matrix rows: 60; failures:
0`; both binaries completed `--version` in every row.

This result primarily demonstrates portability of the chosen static musl
artifacts across those container userspaces. Containers share the host kernel,
and `--version` deliberately does not initialize procfs attribution or either
firewall backend. It is not certification of 60 complete distributions.

## Rust target matrix

`targets.tsv` contains 25 built-in Linux target names. Validate the file with:

```console
scripts/check-target-matrix.sh validate
```

In a Rust 1.98.0 environment with rustup, install missing stable target
components and type-check them with:

```console
scripts/check-target-matrix.sh check --install
```

The harness runs cross-target checks with one Cargo job to bound peak memory and
make the matrix deterministic on constrained builders.

The completed stable run checked 23/23 available stable targets without failures:

| Architecture family | Covered variants |
| --- | --- |
| x86 | i586 and i686; GNU and musl where listed |
| x86_64 / amd64 | GNU and musl |
| ARM | ARMv5, ARMv6, and ARMv7; soft-float and hard-float variants where the Rust target provides them; GNU and musl as listed |
| arm64 / aarch64 | GNU and musl |
| PowerPC 64 LE | `powerpc64le` GNU |
| IBM Z | `s390x` GNU |
| RISC-V 64 | `riscv64gc` GNU/musl and `riscv64a23` GNU |

`riscv32gc-unknown-linux-gnu` and
`riscv32gc-unknown-linux-musl` are recorded as Rust Tier 3. Stable rustup does
not provide their standard libraries, so the stable matrix skips them. Building
them requires a separately reviewed nightly `build-std` workflow; they are not
claimed as stable release targets.

The workflow defines 43 release binary rows and requires each one to be linked,
checked for the expected ELF identity and static runtime boundary, and
smoke-run in a pinned image for its target family and architecture. `amd64` and
`arm64` jobs use native x86-64 and AArch64 runners. `386` uses the x86 runner's
compatibility path. ARMv5, ARMv6, ARMv7, `ppc64le`, `riscv64`, and `s390x` use
digest-pinned Cross build images and a selected QEMU user-mode handler only for
their target-image `--version` binary smoke. The privileged handler registration
step is rejected on self-hosted runners.

A publishable run must install all 37 selected package rows and complete both
backend scenarios for each of them. QEMU user-mode rows do not enter the
package-install or firewall matrices. Their successful binary smoke is not
package-runtime evidence, distribution-kernel coverage, physical-hardware
certification, or a blanket runtime guarantee for ARM, PowerPC, IBM Z, or
RISC-V hardware.
Architecture aliases do not create additional targets: AMD64 means x86_64, and
ARM64 means AArch64. `aarch` alone is not a Rust Linux target name.

## Init-system matrix

Run source/layout checks without Docker:

```console
scripts/test-init-matrix.sh validate
```

Run the isolated parser and supervisor fixtures:

```console
scripts/test-init-matrix.sh manifests
scripts/test-init-matrix.sh containers-clean
```

The completed checks covered staging layouts for all six supported init systems,
OpenRC parsing, SysVinit PID/executable semantics, runit and s6 supervised
start/finish quarantine, s6 dependency compilation, dinit parsing, and both
BusyBox `addgroup` and shadow `groupadd` group creation. systemd is statically
staged and checked separately: the unit with target stubs passed
`systemd-analyze verify`, and offline
`systemd-analyze security --offline=yes --threshold=100` passed with exposure
2.7 (`OK`). Verification and the same 2.7 assessment were repeated with systemd
installed inside the pinned Tumbleweed container. The full tmpfiles
create/relabel declaration for the runtime directory, state directory, and
shared xtables lock also passed repeated application and exact metadata checks.
This matrix does not boot systemd in a container or as PID 1.

The lifecycle fixtures mount a stub daemon. Their successful result does not
mean a backend was selected or that real packets were filtered.

## Real firewall end-to-end workflow

The workflow expands every one of the 37 runtime platform rows into two
complete Learning-to-Enforcing tests: one with nftables preferred while both
frontends are installed, and one with `nft` absent so the complete
iptables/ip6tables fallback must be selected. A publishable run therefore
requires 37 nftables and 37 iptables jobs across DEB, RPM, APK, and Arch
packages on native `amd64`/`arm64` runners and the x86-64 kernel's `386`
compatibility path. QEMU-user rows are excluded. The harness explicitly
provisions the requested backend before installing the release package; that
test setup does not by itself change or broaden a package format's dependency
metadata.

Every release image is pinned by SHA-256 digest and paired with an explicit OCI
platform. The evidence stage records the image/platform identity, package and
binary hashes, installation result, assigned backend results, and expected
release-asset inventory. Docker still uses the runner kernel, so these results
validate container userspace and isolated network-namespace behavior rather
than the distribution's own kernel or a complete init boot.

`../e2e/server-learning-enforcing.sh` creates a disposable Docker network with a
client and HTTP server. It is designed to verify, separately for each backend:

- selection of the requested nftables or iptables backend;
- initial persisted `Learning` mode after startup quarantine;
- observation access for `openshield` and denial for an outsider;
- denial of control to a non-root group member;
- learning an application-bound TCP rule and a UDP rule;
- continued access for the learned executable and denial of another executable
  in `Enforcing`;
- coexistence with a downstream firewall DROP;
- inbound denial followed by an explicit inbound allow;
- graceful-shutdown kernel `BlockAll` without replacing persisted `Enforcing`;
- restart into the persisted mode.

Build daemon binaries compatible with the selected client userspace, then run
each backend explicitly. Debian Bookworm is the default:

```console
tests/e2e/server-learning-enforcing.sh nftables /absolute/bookworm/release-directory
tests/e2e/server-learning-enforcing.sh iptables /absolute/bookworm/release-directory
```

The pinned Tumbleweed snapshot can be selected without changing the script:

```console
CLIENT_FAMILY=tumbleweed CLIENT_IMAGE='opensuse/tumbleweed@sha256:8f6397b7b7ebc78e111d9a13fb2b157664ad5524e1f3b908deb45938b3095045' \
  tests/e2e/server-learning-enforcing.sh nftables /absolute/tumbleweed/release-directory
CLIENT_FAMILY=tumbleweed CLIENT_IMAGE='opensuse/tumbleweed@sha256:8f6397b7b7ebc78e111d9a13fb2b157664ad5524e1f3b908deb45938b3095045' \
  tests/e2e/server-learning-enforcing.sh iptables /absolute/tumbleweed/release-directory
```

The workflow installs packages in the disposable client container and therefore
needs registry/package-network access. Firewall capabilities are granted only
inside that container; the script does not apply rules on the host. Before
creating resources, it reads the active endpoint with `docker context inspect`
and refuses every endpoint whose URI is not `unix:///*`.

Each successful runtime release row reports both backend runs in its selected
userspace:

```text
PASS server Learning -> UDP/TCP Enforcing -> inbound allow -> restart (nftables)
PASS server Learning -> UDP/TCP Enforcing -> inbound allow -> restart (iptables)
```

In an nftables run both frontends are installed and nftables must be selected.
In an iptables run `nft` is absent and the compatibility backend must be
selected, so the pair tests preference and fallback rather than merely forcing
a name.

A successful pair covers the scripted behavior inside disposable network and
container namespaces on a local Unix-socket Docker engine. It does not test or
modify the host firewall and does not certify production kernels, deployments,
upgrades, or competing firewall configurations.
