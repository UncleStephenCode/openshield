# OpenShield architecture

OpenShield is a Linux host firewall composed of two Rust binaries:

- `openshield-daemon` is the only component allowed to change the firewall. It
  owns either a dedicated `inet openshield` nftables table or the reserved
  `OPENSHIELD_*` iptables/ip6tables chains, and persists validated rules.
- `openshield-tui` displays status and events only to root or members of the
  `openshield` system group. Mutating controls are enabled only when the daemon
  authenticates the peer as UID 0.

The daemon never accepts TCP control connections. It exposes two local Unix
sockets below the root-owned `/run/openshield` directory:

| Socket | Mode | Operations |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `control.sock` | UID 0, `0600` | change mode; create, update, enable, disable, or delete rules |
| `observe.sock` | `root:openshield`, `0660` | read a sanitized snapshot and subscribe to bounded events |

Filesystem permissions are defense in depth. Every connection is authenticated
with Linux `SO_PEERCRED`. Control is rejected unless the peer UID is 0.
Observation requires UID 0, a primary `openshield` GID, or a stable
supplementary-group match. For the latter, the daemon reads bounded procfs
credentials twice and verifies the process start time and effective credentials
against `SO_PEERCRED`; ambiguity denies access. Protocol messages use a
length-prefixed JSON frame with a
small fixed maximum size. Slow observers have bounded queues and are dropped,
so they cannot delay packet filtering or policy changes. The observation path
uses 32 fixed workers, a 64-job admission queue, at most 24 live observation
subscriptions, and per-UID limits of four connections and two subscriptions. A
single per-UID token bucket (burst 256, refill 64 tokens/second) is charged both
when a connection is accepted and before each `Status`, `RulesPage`, or
`Subscribe` request; exhaustion returns `Conflict` and closes the session. A
session state machine permits `Subscribe` only as the first
request; snapshot sessions permit at most two `Status` requests and, after rule
pagination begins, only a strictly advancing cursor. For each cursor the server
fetches up to its fixed 128-rule maximum, ignoring a smaller client-supplied
limit, and then binary-searches a shorter page only when needed to keep the
encoded frame within 64 KiB. The response carries a resumable cursor, and the
TUI reuses one connection for the complete snapshot. Each event subscriber has
a 512-event queue, large enough for a complete 256-rule learning batch plus
policy/counter headroom while remaining bounded.
Rule pages and events are redacted server-side for every authorized observer
whose peer UID is not 0: application path, file-version identity, command line,
UID, cgroup, and the potentially identifying rule name are replaced before
serialization. Group membership grants no control-plane authority.
Authorization applies when the Unix connection is accepted; Unix fd passing can
delegate an already-connected observation stream, so group access is not a
non-delegable confidentiality boundary.

Before loading state or invoking a firewall backend, every privileged daemon action takes
a nonblocking exclusive `flock` on the verified root-owned regular `0600`
`/run/openshield/daemon.lock`. The main process retains it for its complete
lifetime; `--install-fail-closed` uses the same lock for its transaction. The
lock pathname is opened with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC`, its inode is never unlinked
by the daemon, and a second instance exits before it can change live policy or
replace IPC sockets. Socket cleanup records the filesystem device/inode created
by each listener and unlinks only that exact object.

Every control mutation carries `expected_revision`, captured when the operator
starts the edit. The engine compares it with current state before cloning,
validation, persistence, or backend work. A mismatch returns `Conflict` with no
side effects. The TUI then requests a fresh snapshot and requires a new operator
action; it never silently retries a stale full-rule update. A transport timeout
or EOF after sending a command is treated as an unconfirmed outcome because the
daemon may have committed before its acknowledgement was lost. The TUI warns
against retrying and resynchronizes instead of claiming the change failed.

## TUI policy projection

The TUI separates Status, Outbound rules, Inbound rules, Events, and Help into
five tabs selected by `1` through `5` or cycled with `Tab`. Status obtains the
active typed backend identity from the daemon and displays `nftables` or the
`iptables`/`ip6tables` fallback independently of observation-stream health. A
`StatusV2` snapshot also displays the policy mode and dynamically recomputed
active policy-path classification. A legacy response is shown as `Unknown`; the
client never infers acceleration from absent data.
An active read-only fail-closed quarantine is reported as L3 with the distinct
`EmergencyBlockAll` reason. Both the level and reason are rendered as an
emergency, so this state cannot look like an operator-selected healthy
`BlockAll`.

The outbound view is a projection over the authoritative rule snapshot, not a
second policy model. It selects exactly one grouping key per rule in priority
order: unified-cgroup-v2 path, exact validated executable path without argv, then
destination network. A rule with no destination network uses an explicit
"any destination" key. All lower-priority selectors remain individual rule
fields. The left pane selects a group; the right pane retains each member and
shows its complete network and application constraints. Navigation follows
stable rule UUIDs so insertion, sorting, or migration between groups cannot
redirect an edit, delete, or enable operation to a different rule. Grouping
never changes matching or creates an implicit bulk mutation.

Inbound rules have a separate view and editor entry point. They expose source
network, local port or range, interface, and protocol, but never an application
selector. `Up`/`Down` change the current group or inbound rule and
`Left`/`Right` change the selected member of an outbound group.
`PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll the complete, bounded rule detail projection. The
current tab supplies the direction for `n`; `e`, `d`, and `Space` act on one
selected UUID. The daemon still independently enforces root-only control;
authorized non-root `openshield` observers can navigate only the redacted,
read-only projection.

## Application attribution

An application selector is valid only on an outbound rule. The executable path
is mandatory, and every persisted selector must also contain its file-version
identity: device, inode, size, and ctime seconds and nanoseconds. Optional exact
constraints are filesystem UID and cgroup path; command arguments use
token-preserving exact or prefix matching. All configured network and application
fields are ANDed. The daemon never executes the path and does not support
environment, regular-expression, parent-process, persistent-PID, MD5, or SHA-1
selectors.

On a cgroup v2 host, the cgroup identity is the path from exactly one unified
procfs entry `0::/path`; missing or multiple unified entries deny attribution.
On a v1-only host, the resolver validates the bounded controller memberships but
returns an empty cgroup identity. Executable path, full file-version identity,
filesystem-UID, and argv attribution therefore remains available, while a rule
that explicitly requires a cgroup path fails closed. A cgroup-path selector
requires unified cgroup v2; application attribution as a whole does not.

This is process-metadata matching, not complete code identity. A dynamically
linked allowed executable can retain every selector field while loading
user-controlled code through `LD_PRELOAD`; interpreters, plugins, and JITs have
the same boundary. Stronger code identity requires an execution-domain control
outside this procfs selector design.

For a privileged manual mutation, the engine must resolve the path inside its own
mount namespace. It canonicalizes the path, opens the canonical target read-only
with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC|O_NONBLOCK`, requires a regular file, then repeats the
canonicalization and open while retaining both handles and performs a final path
check. The canonical path and all five file-version fields must remain stable.
The daemon fills an omitted pin and rejects a conflicting supplied pin; an
unresolvable path is rejected even when the client supplies an identity. Learned
selectors contain the observed path, complete file version, filesystem UID,
exact tokenized argv, and the single unified-cgroup-v2 path when one is
available. On a v1-only host the learned cgroup field is absent.
The TUI omits a pin for a new or changed path so the daemon can derive it; an edit
that preserves the path carries the old complete pin for stale-version rejection.
Serialized application rules that contain only the older device/inode pair fail
closed and must be reviewed and recreated; network-only state is unaffected.

Otherwise-unmatched application traffic enters the fixed NFQUEUE 1337 without
a fail-open queue-bypass flag. The kernel supplies a bounded packet prefix,
socket UID, and output-interface index. A single bounded consumer parses only
TCP, UDP, ICMP echo, and ICMPv6 echo. It may drain at most 32 already-ready
packets without waiting to fill the batch. Every request retains its own
`SOCK_DIAG` tuple-to-inode lookup. The resolver then performs one complete
bounded procfs owner snapshot before identity capture and another after capture
for all targets in the batch. The entire operation shares one absolute 250 ms
deadline, and each snapshot has one global limit of 131,072 owner records across
all targets. These bounds are not multiplied by packet count.

Identity capture can be memoized only within that batch and only for an exact
tuple of socket inode, socket UID, and capture requirements. Duplicate requests
for one socket must reach consensus on mandatory identity: PID, process start
time, executable path, complete file version, and filesystem UID. The optional
argv and cgroup fields are still captured whenever the matching policy requires
them. The typed procfs timeout marker survives batched error propagation and is
recorded by the NFQUEUE runtime counters. A later batch starts again with
per-packet `SOCK_DIAG`; there is no cross-batch process-identity or authorization
cache, so otherwise-unmatched UDP and ICMP packets continue to require fresh
attribution.

For each owner snapshot, external PID/TID entries are enumerated once, every
task's filesystem UID is read, and `/proc/TGID/task/TID/fd` is scanned only when
that UID equals a target's kernel socket UID. Matching holders are grouped by
TGID. A changed before/after snapshot, lack of a matching-UID holder, different
matching TGIDs, inconsistent mandatory identity, incomplete or unavailable live
process/task enumeration, the shared deadline or owner-record bound, or a
candidate descriptor-bound exhaustion makes the affected attribution fail
closed. Sibling holder TIDs in one TGID are accepted as one process only when
their captured executable path/file version, argv, filesystem-UID, and cgroup
enforcement identities are equal. Unsupported traffic, malformed metadata, and
any other configured-bound failure also cause DROP.

The daemon's own TGID is handled separately because its standard Rust threads
share one descriptor table. When its filesystem UID equals the kernel socket UID,
the resolver performs a bounded check of `/proc/<self>/fd` immediately before
external-owner enumeration and another after that enumeration completes. These
are two shared-table checks on a completed owner scan instead of one scan per
daemon thread. Finding the target socket or failing either inspection fails
closed, and the daemon's per-thread fd paths are never accepted as application
owners.
This optimization is valid only while daemon threads retain the standard shared
file table and do not receive file descriptors from another process or change
filesystem UID independently; introducing `unshare(CLONE_FILES)`/
`CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE`, cross-process descriptor receipt, or per-thread
filesystem-UID changes requires re-auditing and, if the invariant no longer
holds, redesigning it.
The normal cross-UID exclusion applies when the UIDs differ. For an external
owner, the descriptor number found for one task is tried first for later
matching-UID tasks in the same scan. Only an exact target-symlink match followed
by a repeated filesystem-UID check is accepted; any mismatch or read error falls
back to that task's complete bounded fd-table scan. This local hint is not
retained across packets. The exact fd path found by the ownership scan is
likewise only a performance hint:
runtime capture revalidates its symlink before reading identity metadata, falls
back to a bounded rescan of that same task's fd table when the hint vanished or
no longer names the target, and rechecks the selected symlink after identity
capture. A revalidation or fallback error fails closed. A vanished procfs entry
is skipped only after disappearance is confirmed.
`PermissionDenied` on a TGID leader's fd table is skipped only after two bounded
`stat` reads confirm stable zombie state `Z`; every other error, non-zombie
state, or unconfirmed state fails closed.
For runtime capture, `/proc/TID/exe` is opened and its complete file version is
compared with a second path/open snapshot together with the remaining process
metadata. Before issuing a successful backend-specific verdict, the engine
rechecks only the current mode and generation under its lock. Its immutable
`Arc<ApplicationDecisionPolicy>` packet-policy
cache contains only enabled application rules in `Enforcing` and is empty in
`Learning` and `BlockAll`; it is rebuilt after a successful policy or learning
commit. The per-packet snapshot acquisition is therefore an O(1) `Arc` clone
instead of a clone of the complete state. The cache indexes rules by the complete
executable file version. A lookup scans only the policy-ordered candidate vector
for that exact version rather than all application rules. A root-edited or legacy
state can still place many rules under one pin, so candidate matching is linear
within that bucket. Learning uses a separate 512-item queue and persists at most
256 observations per batch. This is a rule-index cache, not a process-identity or
authorization-result cache. Apart from the established-TCP conntrack-generation
fast path described below, every queued packet still receives fresh attribution.

Both backend compilers implement an early mark-sanitization step, the main
policy path, and a late authorization path. OpenShield reserves the upper two bits of
the 32-bit packet mark for its pending/handoff handshake and preserves the lower
30 bits through NFQUEUE, so existing lower-bit `fwmark` policy-routing and QoS
values are not discarded. On nftables, an `NF_ACCEPT` verdict leaves the pending
mark unchanged and processing continues into the later authorization base chain.
On iptables, `NF_ACCEPT` would terminate the filter hook, so the daemon returns
`NF_REPEAT` with an authenticated handoff mark; the first rule on the repeated
OpenShield OUTPUT path consumes that domain and transfers control to the
protocol-specific authorization chain. The daemon holds the policy-engine lock
from its final mode/generation recheck through verdict delivery and reinjection.
The netlink verdict socket is nonblocking: send-buffer exhaustion fails the
operation and triggers emergency quarantine instead of blocking every control
operation while the engine lock is held. Both backend paths clear the reserved
packet bits before the packet leaves the pipeline.

Successful application authorization writes an OpenShield domain plus the
current persisted, nonzero 30-bit policy generation into the low 31 conntrack
mark bits while preserving bit 31. TCP uses those low bits as a cache: the
original and reply directions of an established connection must carry that
exact current value. A mode change or rule mutation that can invalidate
authorization advances the generation without reuse, so an old conntrack entry
alone does not keep the connection authorized. The fast path also requires
`ct state established`, so a pre-set mark on NEW traffic cannot skip the
application queue.

Application-bound UDP, ICMP echo, and ICMPv6 echo do not use the mark as an
outbound cache. Before every original packet, the policy clears OpenShield's low
31 conntrack bits while preserving bit 31, then queues and attributes the packet
again. Successful authorization refreshes the current low-31-bit generation so
the matching reply can be accepted. This prevents another process from
inheriting an outbound authorization by reusing a UDP five-tuple while retaining
the unrelated high conntrack bit.

The persisted 30-bit generation advances monotonically by one and is never
reused before exhaustion. Exhaustion rejects mutations that need a new value;
transition to `BlockAll` remains available.

Packet-mark and conntrack-mark interoperability therefore differ. OpenShield
reserves the upper two packet-mark bits and preserves the lower 30. In the
conntrack mark it reserves the low 31 bits and preserves bit 31. Another
firewall, VPN, QoS, or CONNMARK scheme using those low conntrack bits can
overwrite or be overwritten by OpenShield and is not a supported combination;
coexistence is possible only for the preserved high bit after hook ordering has
been reviewed. Other components must also leave the upper two packet-mark bits
unused. A privileged earlier CONNMARK rule can still forge the current low-31-bit
value on an already-established TCP flow, so exclusive ownership of those bits
and compatible hook ordering are security requirements, not only compatibility
advice.

Application rules are still allow rules, not negative overrides. A broader
network-only rule is emitted before the queue and can accept the same traffic
without application attribution. Operators must avoid such overlap when the
application identity is intended to be mandatory.

## Dynamic active-policy path classification

The daemon derives a typed active-policy path classification from the validated
snapshot and returns it in `StatusV2`. The value is recomputed after every
committed mode or rule change and describes the worst-case, most expensive data
path which the current policy can exercise. It is not kernel-capability
attestation or runtime fallback negotiation for an otherwise identical policy:

- **L3 `KernelNative`** applies in `BlockAll` and in `Enforcing` when no enabled
  application-bound rule exists. The selected nftables or iptables compiler
  expresses the complete active filtering policy in kernel rules.
- **L2 `ConntrackHybrid`** applies in `Enforcing` when every enabled
  application-bound rule is TCP. A new TCP connection reaches NFQUEUE for
  process attribution; after successful authorization, packets in both
  directions must carry the exact current conntrack domain/generation and the
  established path remains in the kernel. The generated queue expression is
  TCP-scoped at this level: unrelated UDP and ICMP traffic is resolved by
  kernel network rules or the terminal kernel drop and never enters NFQUEUE.
- **L1 `Nfqueue`** applies throughout `Learning`, and in `Enforcing` when any
  enabled application-bound rule can match UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6, or `Any`.
  Otherwise-unmatched original packets on those paths require fresh userspace
  attribution. This level dominates L2 when both kinds of rule are present.
- **`Unknown`** is reserved for a legacy response or a runtime whose level has
  not been verified. It is never interpreted as one of the accelerated paths.

Disabled application rules do not affect the level. Network-only rules and
packets which match them remain kernel-native at L2 and L1; the reported value
is a conservative daemon-wide summary, not a statement that every packet takes
the same route. A successful mode or rule transaction recomputes the level from
the committed snapshot. Level selection does not relax selector conjunctions,
rewrite a rule, or substitute a network-only allow for an application rule.

Policy mode, firewall backend, and active-path classification are orthogonal
status dimensions. Startup first installs `BlockAll`. Its only automatic
backend fallback is from a fully validated nftables backend to the complete
iptables/ip6tables bundle when nftables is unusable. The same four status
values have the same meaning on both backends. Startup does not activate a
saved non-`BlockAll` policy until the
non-bypass NFQUEUE consumer and the other required resources are ready. If
NFQUEUE setup fails, the daemon retains `BlockAll` and exits rather than
starting with a network-only approximation. A later terminal queue failure
requests emergency `BlockAll`; it never promotes the level or bypasses the
queue.

Normal `BlockAll` and emergency quarantine both execute a kernel-native deny
policy, but they are not operationally equivalent. `StatusV2` reports reason
`BlockAll` for the operator-selected mode and `EmergencyBlockAll` while the
engine is poisoned and read-only. The latter permits observation but rejects
all privileged mutations until recovery.

L3 is a description of the policy currently compiled into nftables or
iptables, not an eBPF implementation. OpenShield 0.1.32 has no eBPF application
data plane, does not retain `CAP_BPF`, does not install a kernel module, and
does not modify boot parameters or MOK state. A future cgroup/BPF-LSM path must
have separate feature/load/attach/exercise probes, exact rule-equivalence tests,
and a fail-closed detach/downgrade transaction before it can introduce a higher
level or change these semantics.

## Modes

`BlockAll`

: Input, output, and forward hooks use a drop policy. No local or forwarded IP
  traffic is permitted. Local Unix-socket control remains available.

`Learning`

: Otherwise-unmatched outbound TCP, UDP, ICMP echo, and ICMPv6 echo connections
  are accepted only after successful fail-closed application attribution. The
  daemon persists validated application-, protocol-, endpoint-, and
  interface-specific outbound allow rules. The application selector pins the
  observed path/version, filesystem UID, exact argv, and available unified-v2
  cgroup path. Unsupported or unattributable
  traffic is denied, not converted into a broad rule. New inbound connections
  remain default-deny; only explicit inbound rules can allow them.

`Enforcing`

: New inbound and outbound connections are default-deny. Enabled network-only
  rules are enforced directly by the selected backend; an application-bound outbound rule
  additionally requires the NFQUEUE identity match. There is no blanket
  established-flow exception, and related traffic requires an explicit rule.

In `BlockAll`, the forward path drops before delegation. In `Learning` and
`Enforcing`, OpenShield returns forwarded traffic to the pre-existing firewall
policy; it neither accepts forwarded traffic nor provides forwarding-rule CRUD.

Mode and rule changes are compiled into a complete backend policy. The preferred
nftables path checks it with `nft --check`, then replaces the dedicated table in
one atomic transaction. The compatibility path uses fixed, validated
`iptables`/`ip6tables` command, restore, and save bundles. It owns only
`OPENSHIELD_*` chains, installs first-position dispatch jumps in the built-in
INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD chains, and uses restore with `--noflush`. Because
xtables cannot atomically update IPv4 and IPv6 together, both families enter
`BlockAll` before the two validated family transactions; a replacement can
temporarily deny traffic but must not create a cross-family authorization
window. An apply or verification failure escalates back to emergency `BlockAll`.
Runtime counters reset on a successful replacement. State is stored in the
root-owned `0600` `/var/lib/openshield/state.json` using a same-directory
temporary file, `fsync`, and atomic rename; unsafe ownership, permissions, file
types, and symbolic links are rejected. Exact argv in learned selectors can
contain secrets, so this file and its backups are confidential; non-root
observation redacts application selectors. A semantic 8 MiB encoded-state quota is checked before backend
application, independently of the 10,000-rule total count limit. Automatic
insertion stops when the state already contains 7,500 learned rules, normally
leaving 2,500 count slots for privileged manual rules; this admission budget is
not a validation invariant for root-edited or legacy state. Root can still fill
the total limit through manual mutations. Rule ordering is
revision-based. If UTC moves backwards, rule
update timestamps are clamped to their prior value so clock correction cannot
make otherwise valid privileged mutations unavailable.

The monitor reads bounded backend-specific chain and counter state once per
second rather than serializing every compiled rule. The iptables path compares
the complete OpenShield-owned rules with the last verified transaction;
the nftables path requests tables, chains, and counters in one fixed `nft`
process, parses exactly three ordered bounded JSON documents, and verifies the
owned table, base hooks, default-drop policies, and named counters. Combining
the three nftables reads removes two process launches but does not change the
one-second cadence, validation invariants, output bounds, or fail-closed repair.
Application learning is fed
by the separate bounded NFQUEUE worker described above. Deduplication builds one
O(N) index for the batch, and one batch persists at most 256 new rules. Automatic
insertion also stops at 512 learned rules per filesystem UID and 256 per pair of
filesystem UID and full executable file-version identity. These are admission
budgets, not absolute state invariants. They use the numeric filesystem UID;
distinct subordinate UIDs count independently and can distribute learning until
the global budget is reached. The engine keeps a second immutable
`ApplicationLearningAdmissionIndex` and rebuilds it together with the packet
policy at startup and after every successful normal, learning, or emergency state
replacement. After mandatory race-checked procfs attribution, it rechecks poison
state, mode, generation, index revision, and persistence status under the engine
lock. The index recognizes exact learned outbound keys and the total, global
learned, per-filesystem-UID, and per-UID/file-version counts. Exact-known,
saturated, and persistence-paused observations are allowed by the active
`Learning` decision without entering the 512-item queue; only a potential new
candidate is enqueued, and queue full/disconnect remains fail-closed. The worker
also coalesces exact duplicates in each bounded 256-observation drain. This keeps
known or necessarily discarded observations from consuming queue capacity, but
does not avoid their procfs attribution. A saturated endpoint has no new rule
persisted, so the same traffic is denied after a switch to Enforcing unless
another rule matches. Ten thousand total rules
and 8 MiB are independent absolute state limits. Reaching the byte quota or a
recoverable save failure discards the current batch and pauses all further
automatic learning in that daemon process until a successful privileged policy
mutation or a restart; the active `Learning` traffic behavior remains in force.
An argv or unified-v2 cgroup change creates a distinct candidate rather than
widening an existing learned selector. Operators must therefore conduct Learning
in a controlled window and review its exact selectors before Enforcing.

Application Learning uses a serialized two-phase persistence transaction.
Under the `Engine` mutex the worker validates the base state, builds the
candidate and events, reserves persistence, and installs the pending-candidate
admission index. Atomic save and file/directory `fsync` then run without that
mutex, keeping packet snapshots, admission, and verdict rechecks live during
storage latency. Exact endpoints in the pending candidate are deduplicated.
Finalization reacquires the mutex, verifies the transaction token and exact base
state, and publishes state and events only after durable commit. Other
privileged mutations return `Conflict` while persistence is reserved. Root
`BlockAll` is the exception: it installs the kernel deny immediately, then
persists the combined blocked state after the learning write and supersedes its
finalizer. Recoverable failures retain the prior state and pause persistence;
unsafe storage, rollback, or base-state outcomes enter fail-closed quarantine.

After a save error the daemon rereads authoritative state: an exact previous
snapshot is left untouched, while a candidate or unknown result is rolled back.
Only an ambiguous result together with failed rollback escalates to `BlockAll`. This keeps health
and learning work bounded. The nftables lightweight observation does not compare
complete rule bodies; a privileged targeted edit or additional allow can evade
it. The iptables comparison is stricter for owned chains, but no monitor makes
arbitrary concurrent privileged firewall editors a supported configuration.

## Performance verification model

The isolated harness in [`tests/perf`](../tests/perf/README.md) exercises the
same nftables and, where the kernel supports it, iptables/ip6tables paths as the
daemon. Network-only policy is measured in both `Learning` and `Enforcing`;
outbound application TCP and UDP use privileged exact rules in `Enforcing` and
persisted learned rules in `Learning`. The DUT creates the real
`/var/lib/openshield` directory in its writable container overlay rather than a
`tmpfs`, so the production atomic-rename and `fsync` state path is exercised.
State and learned rules survive phase-client exits and daemon control
transactions within one backend topology, but that disposable writable layer
is not reused by a later independent harness run.

Warm-up, every ramp step, every steady repetition, and burst each start an
independent client process and initial socket set. The server remains alive for
the whole load point. Application TCP fast-path evidence is collected inside
each phase: a keep-alive connection first crosses NFQUEUE for process
attribution and then carries multiple request/response operations under the
current conntrack generation. No established connection is carried across a
phase boundary. A bounded 50--3,600,000 ms weighted lifetime distribution is
selected deterministically for every persistent connection. Expiry closes and
reopens an ordinary TCP socket between completed exchanges, producing a real
new conntrack/NFQUEUE attribution path without interrupting in-flight work;
short-connection profiles validate but otherwise ignore the lifetime. Each
exact backend/policy/mode/profile/load group has three predetermined,
independent baseline/protected pairs. Every pair has unique pair and baseline
sample identities, uses its baseline exactly once, and runs its sides in
separate pristine DUT generations. The daemon is never started on the baseline
DUT. Pair order is fixed before measurement and balanced AB/BA, and a protected
block may use only its assigned immediately adjacent baseline. Both sides use
identical offered parameters and a policy-independent deterministic trace seed;
conntrack is flushed before each baseline and policy load point. The
conservative comparison gap is the maximum temporal separation across the
authenticated workload interval and the synchronized DUT and peer metric
intervals. It must not exceed 15 seconds in CI or 90 seconds in the
production-like profile.

The configuration, synchronized metrics, and baseline-pairing contracts are
versioned as `openshield.perf.config.v2`, `openshield.perf.metrics.v3`, and
`openshield.perf.baseline-pairing.v2`. The result model separates validity,
capacity, and safety. Generator CPU or
scheduler saturation and peer/server CPU, rejection, or protocol saturation
invalidate a window; an invalid baseline propagates to its pair. Valid windows
then have formal configured gates for target attainment, latency, loss,
retransmits, daemon CPU/RSS, interface errors, NFQUEUE drops, and expected queue
shape. Repeated wrong-executable probes during application bursts and direct
kernel inspection of a reported quarantine prevent a fail-open result from
passing. Every executed invalid result row fails the complete report rather
than being silently excluded; invalid points also cannot become capacity
evidence. A production maximum requires three successful steady repetitions.

Relative performance uses those independent adjacent pristine AB/BA pairs.
Every window delta and threshold crossing is preserved as evidence. The
CI observation threshold remains 10%. Its authenticated configuration assigns
relative throughput/PPS means to the blocking `fail` action and, for the
v0.1.32 field-evaluation period, assigns relative CPU and latency means to the
non-blocking `observe` action. The production-like profile assigns all four to
`fail`. A one-sided 95% Student-t lower confidence bound records stronger
confirmation without changing the configured action. A single
burst has no repeated-sample confidence claim, so its relative crossing is
evaluated directly: throughput/PPS blocks, while CPU/latency follows the
profile action. Its validity, configured capacity bounds, and safety are also
mandatory. Safety signals such as loss, retransmits, NIC or NFQUEUE
drops/errors, and fail-open behavior fail immediately and are not subject to
the statistical relative decision. Host `/proc/softirqs` counters are not
namespaced or attributable to the daemon; they are interpreted only as a
paired-baseline delta on a quiet runner. The bounded release smoke follows
the functional firewall E2E jobs, but its three short steady repetitions
validate the path and safety gate rather than certifying a capacity maximum.

A separate configured overload gate deliberately stops the daemon with
`SIGSTOP`, drives real application TCP and UDP until the bounded NFQUEUE shows
at least the required combined kernel/userspace drop count, and repeatedly
tests a different executable while the consumer is stalled. The pressure
client first publishes readiness and waits at an explicit start barrier. A
separate network-only endpoint on the same canary veth and transport must
complete a real round trip immediately before and after every negative probe;
resource saturation or socket/NIC errors at the generator, peer, or canary make
the proof invalid. `SIGCONT` is attempted in a `finally` path, with
disposable-container teardown as the outer fallback. After resume, the daemon
must either retain `Enforcing` and pass an allowed-traffic recovery exchange or
expose a `BlockAll` quarantine independently verified in the selected kernel
backend. A reported quarantine additionally requires bracketed real TCP and UDP
negative probes while loopback round trips inside the canary container prove
both peer servers healthy immediately before and after each probe. The
different executable must remain blocked both during and after the stall. This
controlled test is a fail-closed stress proof and is kept out of capacity
calculations. Its TCP pressure payload forces short connections, so the
inherited validated keep-alive lifetime distribution cannot reduce NFQUEUE
saturation pressure.

## Trust boundaries

The daemon trusts the Linux kernel, UID 0, and the selected fixed system backend
executables. nftables is preferred only after a read-only preflight verifies
the previous xtables state, table ownership, the exact bounded JSON table,
chain, and counter queries needed by runtime observation, and a representative
Learning policy with the kernel's check-only transaction. The fallback requires
complete trusted IPv4 and IPv6 xtables bundles. Executable
paths come from compiled allowlists, are metadata-checked, and are invoked with a
cleared environment and typed arguments, never a shell. The daemon does not load
plugins, scripts, downloaded policy, eBPF objects, or configuration-selected
executables. User-provided values become firewall syntax only after parsing into
typed IP networks, ports, protocols, directions, and a strictly validated
interface name. Application values remain typed identity data and are never
interpreted as commands.

The packaged systemd process retains `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_NET_RAW`,
`CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`. It keeps primary group `root` and
explicitly adds `openshield` as a supplementary group. As the socket owner it
assigns that group to a new observation socket without `CAP_CHOWN`. Legacy
xtables needs `CAP_NET_RAW` to open the
raw IPv4/IPv6 sockets used for alternate-backend inspection and fallback;
the last two capabilities let procfs access checks permit identity inspection
across local UIDs. Its syscall filter explicitly denies `ptrace`, `process_vm_readv`,
`process_vm_writev`, `kcmp`, `pidfd_getfd`, and `open_by_handle_at`, and it does
not normally read process memory or environments. This deny list is not memory
isolation: `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` can authorize a compromised daemon to open
`/proc/<pid>/mem`, after which ordinary read/write syscalls remain available.
Together with `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`, procfs magic links such as
`/proc/<pid>/root` can also expose another process's mount view despite service
mount restrictions. The retained capabilities therefore materially expand the
impact of a daemon compromise and are inside the trusted computing base.

The observation API reveals firewall mode, rules, aggregate one-second counters,
and learned network endpoints only to root and members of `openshield`. For an
authorized non-root observer, all application metadata and identifying rule
names are redacted by the daemon. UID 0 can read the full rule, including
bounded command-line selectors. Runtime attribution reads bounded procfs
identity metadata and a bounded queued-packet prefix, but never the process
environment; version 0.1 does not provide a per-packet capture feed.

## Failure policy

Network-only decisions stay in the selected kernel backend. Initial application decisions use the
fixed bounded NFQUEUE, deliberately without queue bypass. A missing, overloaded,
or failed consumer therefore denies queued traffic instead of allowing it; a
terminal queue error asks the engine to install emergency `BlockAll` and stops
the daemon. A crashed or overloaded TUI has no effect on either path.

On every daemon start, the engine first installs kernel `BlockAll`, then loads
state, increments the persisted nonzero 30-bit flow generation by exactly one,
and persists it before applying the requested policy. The monotonic counter is
not reused before exhaustion, so conntrack authorization marks from every
earlier daemon process are invalid. Exhaustion retains `BlockAll` and fails
startup instead of wrapping. This startup quarantine also applies when the
daemon is invoked directly without the packaged `ExecStartPre` helper.

Missing state is initialized and persisted as `Learning`, while kernel
`BlockAll` remains active until that new policy can be activated. Invalid or
unsafe existing state causes the daemon to retain `BlockAll`, keep IPC sockets
closed, and exit with failure. Automatic restart attempts continue to fail
closed and cannot reach readiness until the operator repairs the state. If
runtime backend objects disappear or differ from verified invariants, the
monitor attempts to reinstall the current validated snapshot;
failure escalates to emergency `BlockAll`. The emergency state keeps the last
validated rules as policy data while its mode provides no accept path. If that
state is persisted, the daemon asks the service manager for a restart. If
persistence itself fails, it deliberately stays alive in a poisoned read-only
quarantine with kernel `BlockAll` active; automatically restarting could
otherwise load an ambiguous permissive file.

Graceful daemon shutdown installs kernel `BlockAll` without persisting a mode
change. The systemd, OpenRC, SysVinit, runit, s6, and dinit integrations provide
corresponding pre-start and post-stop quarantine hooks. Their ordering is a
service-manager boundary, not proof of coverage for initramfs or early traffic.

The packaged systemd unit also installs `BlockAll` in `ExecStartPre` and
`ExecStopPost`. Its main
process uses `Type=notify` and sends `READY=1` only after the persisted policy is
active, the fail-closed NFQUEUE consumer is bound, and the fixed IPC sockets have
been verified. It requires `systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service`; the package's
tmpfiles rules create root-owned runtime/state directories and the standard
`0600` `/run/xtables.lock`, then relabel those exact paths without recursively
touching their contents. The unit grants write access only to those paths
instead of all of `/run` or `/var/lib`.
Its `[Install]` section contains
`RequiredBy=network-pre.target`; after `systemctl enable openshield-daemon`, that
success dependency combines with `Before=network-pre.target` so a standard
consumer cannot proceed through the target unless the daemon reaches readiness.

This boundary applies only after the unit is enabled and only to consumers that
honour `network-pre.target`. A network manager, unit, initramfs, or early packet
path that bypasses the target also bypasses the dependency. Strict whole-boot
enforcement therefore requires tested distribution-specific integration or an
initramfs policy.
