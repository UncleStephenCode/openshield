# Threat model

## Security objectives

1. A non-root local user cannot change firewall mode or rules.
2. A malformed, slow, or flooding observer cannot stop enforcement or consume
   unbounded memory, threads, or event queues.
3. Policy input cannot select commands, plugins, or executable code. An
   application path is identity data only and is never executed.
4. Failed parsing, persistence, identity attribution, or firewall-backend updates
   preserve or strengthen the last known policy; they must not silently allow
   traffic.
5. New inbound traffic is denied unless an enabled inbound rule matches.
6. In enforcing mode, new outbound traffic is denied unless all fields of an
   enabled outbound rule match, including its application selector when present.
7. Missing, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or over-limit application identity
   information results in DROP, not a network-wide fallback allow.
8. A non-root observer cannot obtain executable paths, complete file-version
   identities, command arguments, UID or cgroup selectors, or identifying names of
   application-bound rules through the observation protocol.
9. `BlockAll` denies forwarded traffic. `Learning` and `Enforcing` delegate it
   to the existing firewall without accepting it or providing forwarding-rule
   CRUD.
10. Active-policy path reporting cannot turn an unverified or more expensive
    application path into a claimed kernel fast path. Missing legacy status data
    is `Unknown`, and an unavailable mandatory NFQUEUE runtime keeps `BlockAll`
    active and stops startup. A live read-only emergency quarantine is reported
    as `EmergencyBlockAll`, not as a healthy operator-selected `BlockAll`.

## Attacker model

The design assumes an attacker may:

- run arbitrary processes as any unprivileged local UID;
- choose command arguments and move a process within cgroups available to that
  user;
- inherit, duplicate, or pass socket descriptors and deliberately create
  ambiguous ownership;
- create many connections or processes to exhaust bounded attribution and
  learning capacity;
- create files and sockets in world-writable directories and modify files the
  attacker owns;
- connect repeatedly to the observation socket and send malformed frames;
- control remote endpoints and packet contents;
- supply every editable rule field through the TUI or protocol.

The observation feed is not available to an arbitrary local UID: the attacker
must also compromise root or membership in the `openshield` group to read it.

A compromised kernel, compromised UID 0, or a malicious replacement for a
selected root-owned backend executable is outside this boundary. Such an attacker already
has authority equivalent to the firewall daemon. Compromise of the daemon itself
is addressed as a high-impact residual risk because its retained capabilities
are broader than firewall administration alone.

## Controls inherited from the OpenSnitch audit

- Sockets are under a verified root-owned directory, never predictable paths in
  `/tmp`. Control is owned by UID 0, has mode `0600`, and checks `SO_PEERCRED`
  UID 0; its group does not participate in authorization.
  Observation is `root:openshield` `0660` and checks `SO_PEERCRED` plus a
  bounded stable primary/supplementary-group identity before serving data.
- There is no unauthenticated TCP/gRPC management endpoint and no TLS fail-open
  mode.
- The protocol has bounded frames, connection limits, absolute request
  deadlines, and bounded subscriber queues. Observation uses 32 fixed workers,
  a 64-job queue, at most 24 observation subscriptions (two per UID), and at most four
  connections per UID. One per-UID bucket has a 256-token burst, refills at 64
  tokens/s, and is charged both on connection acceptance and before each
  `Status`, `RulesPage`, or `Subscribe`; exhaustion closes the session. The
  connection state machine permits `Subscribe` only first,
  bounds pre-pagination `Status` requests to two, and then accepts only strictly
  advancing rule cursors. The server ignores smaller client limits, fetches up
  to 128 rules per cursor, and byte-shrinks only to fit the 64 KiB frame bound,
  returning a resumable cursor. A subscriber is disconnected if its bounded
  512-event queue fills.
- The daemon never accepts arbitrary task paths, logger paths, eBPF module paths,
  shell commands, or downloadable plugins. A validated application path is a
  bounded selector and is never invoked.
- Rule identifiers are UUIDs; display names are never filesystem paths.
- Persistence rejects symbolic links and uses fixed root-owned locations.
- Normal daemon code does not read process environments or process memory.
  Before serializing a response for a non-root observer, the daemon replaces the
  complete application selector and its potentially identifying rule name with
  fixed redacted values.
- Network-only decisions remain in default-drop backend chains. Initial
  application decisions use the fixed NFQUEUE 1337 with no fail-open bypass flag, a
  maximum kernel queue length of 256 packets, and a 512-byte copy range.
- `StatusV2` reports policy mode, firewall backend, and the dynamically
  recomputed active-policy path classification as separate typed fields. It is
  not kernel-capability attestation or fallback negotiation. The value is derived from committed
  enabled rules: `KernelNative` only for `BlockAll` or application-free
  `Enforcing`, `ConntrackHybrid` only for TCP-only application `Enforcing`, and
  `Nfqueue` for `Learning` or any enabled per-packet application protocol.
  Absent legacy data defaults to `Unknown`. This status is descriptive and
  cannot broaden a rule. Network-only traffic stays in the kernel at every
  known level. Failure to initialize mandatory NFQUEUE leaves the bootstrap
  `BlockAll` policy installed and terminates the daemon instead of falling back
  to a network-only or queue-bypass policy.
  The only automatic startup backend fallback is nftables to the complete
  iptables/ip6tables bundle when nftables cannot be validated.
- The queue consumer accepts only successfully parsed TCP, UDP, ICMP echo, and
  ICMPv6 echo traffic. It drains no more than 32 already-ready packets and never
  waits to fill a batch. Every packet independently maps its kernel UID and
  network tuple to a socket inode through `SOCK_DIAG`. One bounded external
  PID/TID owner snapshot before identity capture and another after capture are
  shared across the batch. One absolute 250 ms deadline covers the complete
  operation, and each snapshot has one global cap of 131,072 owner records
  across all targets. These bounds are not multiplied by packet count. Identity
  capture is memoized only inside the batch for the
  same inode, socket UID, and capture requirements. Requests sharing a socket
  must agree on PID, process start time, executable path and complete file
  version, and filesystem UID. The typed timeout marker is preserved for
  NFQUEUE accounting. There is no cross-batch process-identity or
  authorization-result cache; a later UDP/ICMP batch starts with new per-packet
  `SOCK_DIAG` lookups and fresh owner snapshots. The resolver scans a task's fd table only when
  its filesystem UID equals the kernel socket UID; matching holders are grouped
  by TGID. When the UIDs match, the
  daemon's shared `/proc/<self>/fd` table is checked immediately before the
  external scan and again after that scan completes: two bounded checks per
  completed owner scan replace per-self-thread fd scans. A target socket or
  failed check produces DROP, and self task fd tables
  are excluded from attribution. Within one external scan, a descriptor number
  found for one task is tried first on later matching-UID tasks. Only an exact
  target link with a repeated UID check is accepted; a mismatch or read error
  falls back to a complete bounded fd-table scan, and the hint is not retained
  across batches. A changed before/after owner snapshot, the absence of a matching-UID holder, different matching TGIDs,
  an incomplete or unavailable live process/task scan, or candidate
  descriptor-bound exhaustion produces DROP. Sibling holder TIDs in one TGID
  count as one process only if their captured executable path/file version, argv,
  filesystem-UID, and cgroup identities agree. The exact fd path found by the owner scan is not trusted as
  authorization: it is revalidated before identity capture, a vanished or moved
  hint triggers one bounded rescan of the same task, and the selected fd is
  rechecked after capture. A vanished
  entry is skipped only after procfs confirms disappearance. `PermissionDenied`
  on a TGID-leader fd table is skipped only after two bounded `stat` reads
  confirm stable zombie state `Z`; every other error, non-zombie state, or
  unconfirmed state produces DROP. Any remaining failure, ambiguity, configured
  bound, or the shared 250 ms procfs deadline also produces
  DROP. The policy generation is rechecked under the engine lock, which remains
  held through the backend-specific verdict and packet reinjection. nftables
  returns `NF_ACCEPT` and completes authorization in a later base chain;
  iptables returns `NF_REPEAT` with an authenticated `NFQA_MARK` handoff that
  the first repeated OpenShield OUTPUT rule consumes. The verdict socket is
  nonblocking: terminal send failure requests emergency `BlockAll` instead of
  indefinitely holding the policy lock.
- The upper two packet-mark bits form an internal pending/handoff domain and are
  stripped from untrusted outbound marks; the lower 30 packet bits survive the
  complete NFQUEUE path. Successful established-TCP authorization writes a
  persisted, nonzero, non-reused domain/generation into the low 31 conntrack
  bits while preserving bit 31, binding both TCP directions and invalidating
  older connections after restrictive policy changes. UDP/ICMP uses no
  outbound cache: the low 31 bits are cleared before every original packet,
  the packet is re-attributed, and successful authorization refreshes those
  bits for the matching inbound reply.
- A persisted application selector requires a canonical absolute executable path
  and the full file-version tuple `(device, inode, size, ctime seconds, ctime
  nanoseconds)`. For manual create/update, the daemon must resolve the path in
  its own mount namespace and compares repeated canonical-path and opened-file
  snapshots; it fills an omitted pin and rejects a stale supplied pin. Exact
  filesystem UID, exact unified-cgroup-v2 path, and tokenized exact or prefix
  command-line constraints are optional; every supplied network and application
  field is combined with AND. On v2 the cgroup identity comes from exactly one
  `0::/path` entry. On a v1-only host, bounded memberships are validated but the
  identity is empty: executable path, full file version, UID, and argv attribution
  remains available, while an explicit cgroup-path selector cannot match. Older
  persisted two-field application pins are rejected rather than silently
  repinned; network-only state remains compatible.
- Stateful reverse traffic is tied to the current generation of a live
  application allow rule; an old conntrack entry alone is not an authorization
  in enforcing mode. Unsolicited inbound traffic still requires an explicit
  inbound allow.
- Learned authorizations retain the observed application identity, protocol,
  endpoint, and outbound interface, so a VPN or link-local endpoint does not
  silently become allowed for another program or on every interface.
- Application learning uses a separate bounded 512-item queue and persists no
  more than 256 observations per batch. Automatic insertion stops when existing
  learned counts reach 7,500 globally, 512 per filesystem UID, or 256 per pair
  of filesystem UID and complete executable file version. These are admission
  budgets rather than validation invariants for legacy or root-edited state.
  Distinct subordinate UIDs count separately, so one operator-controlled UID
  range can distribute activity until the global budget. The 10,000 total-rule
  limit normally leaves 2,500 count slots for privileged manual rules; the exact
  8 MiB encoded-state quota is independent. After mandatory procfs attribution,
  a revision-checked immutable admission index classifies an exact-known,
  count-saturated, persistence-paused, or potential-new observation. Only the
  potential new candidate enters the 512-item queue; the other three retain the
  current `Learning` allow without consuming queue capacity. A mode/generation,
  poison, or cache-consistency mismatch fails closed, and the worker coalesces
  exact duplicates in each bounded 256-observation drain. A count-saturated
  endpoint therefore has no persisted permit in Enforcing. Reaching
  the byte quota or a recoverable save failure discards that batch and pauses
  all automatic learning in the daemon process until a successful privileged
  mutation or restart, while retaining the previous state and active traffic
  policy. Persistence is two-phase: preparation, reservation, and the pending
  admission index run under the engine lock, while atomic save and `fsync` run
  after releasing it. Exact pending matches are deduplicated; state and events
  are published only after durable commit. Other privileged controls return
  `Conflict`. Root `BlockAll` instead installs the kernel deny immediately and
  is serialized last. Unsafe storage or base-state outcomes enter fail-closed
  quarantine rather than publishing an uncommitted candidate.
- Every daemon start first installs kernel `BlockAll`. Missing state is persisted
  as `Learning`; an existing saved mode is preserved. The engine increments the
  persisted nonzero 30-bit flow generation by exactly one, persists the new
  value, and only then applies the requested policy. Generations are never
  reused before exhaustion, so TCP authorization marks from every earlier daemon
  process remain invalid. Exhaustion retains `BlockAll` and fails startup rather
  than wrapping the counter.
- Graceful daemon shutdown and every packaged post-stop hook install kernel
  `BlockAll` without overwriting the persisted requested mode. Forced
  termination, early boot, and initramfs paths remain deployment boundaries.
- The packaged unit installs `BlockAll` before its main process and reports
  systemd readiness only after the selected policy, fail-closed queue consumer,
  and IPC endpoints are active. It requires tmpfiles setup to pre-create the
  root-owned runtime/state directories and standard `0600` `/run/xtables.lock`,
  and grants write access to those exact paths rather than all of `/run` or
  `/var/lib`. Non-recursive relabeling preserves their policy-defined SELinux
  contexts without altering stored state. Once enabled, its
  `RequiredBy=network-pre.target` installation dependency and
  `Before=network-pre.target` ordering make standard consumers depend on that
  successful readiness; the scope limitation is recorded below.
- A verified root-owned `0600` singleton lock is acquired before any state or
  backend mutation, including `--install-fail-closed`; stale socket cleanup is
  bound to the device/inode created by that daemon instance.
- Every root control mutation is conditional on its source snapshot revision.
  Concurrent or stale edits fail with `Conflict` before side effects, and the
  TUI resynchronizes without automatically replaying the rejected intent.
- A lost acknowledgement is not reported as a failed mutation: the TUI treats
  transport errors as ambiguous, warns against retrying, and reloads state.
- UTC rollback cannot invalidate a rule update: revisions define ordering and
  persisted `updated_at` values are kept monotonic.
- The packaged unit limits the daemon to `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_NET_RAW`,
  `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`. It keeps primary group `root` and
  adds supplementary group `openshield`; the socket owner can select that
  group without retaining `CAP_CHOWN`. `CAP_NET_RAW` is required for legacy
  xtables inspection and fallback operation; the syscall filter denies `ptrace`,
  `process_vm_readv`, `process_vm_writev`, `kcmp`, `pidfd_getfd`, and
  `open_by_handle_at`.

## Residual risks

- The dynamically recomputed active-policy path is a worst-case classification,
  not a kernel feature attestation, runtime fallback negotiation for an
  unchanged policy, or proof that every packet follows one path.
  Since version 0.1.31, `KernelNative` means nftables/iptables policy evaluation; it
  does not mean eBPF application attribution. This release ships no eBPF
  application data plane and makes no `CAP_BPF`, boot-parameter, MOK, or kernel
  module change. The procfs/NFQUEUE attribution risks below therefore remain.
  The only automatic startup backend fallback is nftables to the complete
  iptables/ip6tables bundle when nftables cannot be validated.

- The packaged `RequiredBy=network-pre.target` relationship is created by
  `systemctl enable`; merely installing the unit does not activate it. A network
  manager, unit, initramfs, or early packet path that bypasses
  `network-pre.target` also bypasses this dependency and may send traffic
  without OpenShield. Strict whole-boot enforcement requires tested
  distribution-specific integration or an initramfs policy.
- The `root:openshield` `0660` observation feed exposes mode, network rules,
  endpoints, events, and aggregate counters to every member of that group.
  Application selectors and identifying application-rule names are redacted for
  a non-root member, but the remaining data can still be sensitive. Group
  membership must therefore be managed as a monitoring privilege and audited.
  Authorization happens when a Unix connection is accepted; an authorized
  member can relay the already-connected socket fd to another process, so this
  group check is not a non-delegable confidentiality boundary.
- Procfs attribution is a bounded, repeated post-hoc consistency check, not an
  atomic kernel record of the process generation that initiated an operation.
  In particular, a process can enqueue a packet and then exec an allowed image
  while retaining the socket; the resolver may observe only the post-exec image
  and authorize an operation initiated before exec. Repeated reads detect
  changes during the scan but cannot reconstruct sender/exec history. UDP
  `SO_REUSEPORT` groups and wildcard/specific binds under the same UID can also
  change the actual sender while tuple and UID observations remain compatible.
  The implementation does not provide an atomic sender record or cryptographic
  process attestation.
- An executable is identified by canonical path plus device, inode, size, and
  ctime at nanosecond field precision. An ordinary in-place rewrite changes size
  or ctime and therefore stops matching, but this tuple is neither a content
  digest nor a mount-namespace identity. Filesystems with coarse or reused
  metadata, privileged/raw-filesystem manipulation, and namespace/path aliases
  remain outside a cryptographic identity guarantee. Script execution may
  identify the interpreter rather than the script the operator had in mind.
  Protect application files with root ownership and non-writable parent
  directories, and explicitly repin reviewed rules after software updates.
- These fields identify observed process metadata, not all code executing inside
  that process. For example, `LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/evil.so /allowed/path` preserves
  the executable path and full file version, argv, filesystem UID, and cgroup while a
  constructor can perform network I/O. Interpreters, plugins, and JIT-generated
  code have the same boundary; hashing only the main executable would not fix
  it. Strong code identity requires a trusted launcher/cgroup with
  user-controlled loaders disabled, or an LSM/IMA/eBPF execution domain.
- Command-line and cgroup values are mutable process metadata collected after a
  packet enters the queue. Repeated reads detect observed changes, but they do
  not make those values immutable. The UID selector is the numeric filesystem
  UID, not a real/effective/saved-UID tuple.
- Unified cgroup v2 is required only for an exact cgroup-path selector. A v1-only
  host can still attribute executable path, full file version, filesystem UID, and
  argv after validating bounded v1 memberships, but reports no cgroup identity;
  an explicit cgroup-path rule therefore fails closed.
- At initial attribution, stable shared, inherited, or `SCM_RIGHTS`-passed
  descriptors can make procfs ownership differ from the process that actually
  sent the packet. Multiple matching-UID TGIDs are denied. A task whose
  filesystem UID differs from the kernel socket UID is excluded before its fd
  table is scanned: if no matching-UID holder remains, attribution fails closed,
  but if the original matching-UID holder retains the descriptor, a cross-UID
  recipient is invisible to this fallback and the original holder can be
  attributed. Kernel-LSM sender attribution is not implemented; procfs ownership
  is not proof of the actual sender.
- Process identity is resolved for the first queued packet of an established TCP
  connection rather than every subsequent TCP packet. A later exec,
  filesystem-UID/cgroup change, or descriptor transfer can continue that
  connection until reconnection or a policy-generation change. UDP/ICMP is
  re-attributed for every outbound packet, but neither path is kernel
  exec-lifecycle enforcement.
- One bounded NFQUEUE consumer performs procfs work that is worst-case
  proportional to process/task enumeration plus the descriptor tables of tasks
  whose filesystem UID matches the socket UID. One directory walk inspects at
  most 4,096 fd entries per matching-UID task and fails if proof requires a later
  entry. A v0.1.32 batch performs two owner snapshots, each admitting at most
  131,072 owner records globally across all of its targets; its single 250 ms
  deadline bounds both scans and every intervening lookup and capture.
  Process/thread floods, a matching-UID fd flood, queue pressure, or the
  250 ms deadline can therefore deny legitimate traffic. This is an
  availability/denial-of-service risk, not a fail-open path. An incomplete live
  process/task enumeration remains globally fail-closed; an oversized fd table
  affects attribution for traffic with its matching socket UID, while unrelated
  UID fd tables are skipped. An inaccessible non-zombie candidate, a state that
  cannot be confirmed as a stable zombie, or an error other than the narrowly
  handled `PermissionDenied` case has the same fail-closed availability effect.
  The v0.1.18 optimization replaces per-self-thread fd scans with two bounded
  checks of the daemon's shared table and normally avoids rescanning the selected
  external task's fd table during identity capture. The scan-local fd-number hint
  can also avoid redundant sibling-table enumeration, but every miss falls back
  to the complete bounded scan. These changes do not skip the fresh external
  PID/TID scan, introduce an authorization-result cache, or change the worst-case
  complexity. Sustained packet rates or hostile procfs cardinality can therefore
  still saturate the consumer and deny legitimate traffic.
  The v0.1.32 micro-batch amortizes those two snapshots across at most 32
  already-ready packets, but it deliberately retains per-packet `SOCK_DIAG`,
  permits identity reuse only inside the current batch, and requires stable
  before/after ownership plus mandatory-identity consensus. It reduces common-
  case work; it is not an authorization cache and cannot remove the worst-case
  fail-closed availability limit.
  The immutable application-policy cache removes a full-state clone from each
  packet and indexes enabled rules by complete executable file version. A lookup
  scans only the policy-ordered bucket for the observed version, rather than all
  application rules. Matching within that bucket remains linear; a root-edited or
  legacy state can concentrate many rules under one pin despite the 256-rule
  automatic-insertion budget.
  The Learning admission index prevents already-known, saturated, and paused
  observations from filling the persistence queue, but it runs only after the
  mandatory process attribution. A stream of new eligible candidates can still
  fill that queue and fail closed, and every class can still consume procfs work.
  The nonblocking verdict socket prevents a send stall from retaining the policy
  lock indefinitely, but sustained netlink send pressure can request emergency
  `BlockAll`; this is an intentional fail-closed availability tradeoff.
- `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` are retained so the hardened service
  can inspect another UID's protected procfs metadata. Denying `ptrace` and
  `process_vm_*` does not provide memory isolation: a compromised daemon can use
  `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` to open `/proc/<pid>/mem` and then use ordinary read/write
  syscalls. `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` can also bypass read/search permissions for
  files visible inside the service mount namespace, including system secrets;
  following `/proc/<pid>/root` and related procfs magic links may additionally
  reach a target process's mount view despite the service's mount hardening. The
  daemon therefore retains broader readable-procfs and filesystem access.
- Application rules are allow rules, not deny overrides. A broader matching
  network-only rule is evaluated before the application queue and can authorize
  the same traffic without application identity. Operators must avoid such
  overlap when application binding is intended to be mandatory.
- OpenShield reserves the upper two packet-mark bits and preserves the lower
  30. It reserves the low 31 conntrack-mark bits for application authorization
  and preserves bit 31. Other packet-mark users must avoid those upper two bits;
  another firewall, VPN, QoS, or CONNMARK writer must avoid the low 31 conntrack
  bits. Conflicting use may break either policy. More seriously, a privileged earlier
  chain that copies an attacker-controlled `SO_MARK` into the conntrack mark
  before OpenShield's sanitizer can create the current domain/generation value
  and bypass the TCP application queue for an established flow. OpenShield
  requires exclusive ownership of its low 31 conntrack bits and compatible hook ordering. An
  external asynchronous queue between its priority-0 policy chain and
  priority-1 late chain also breaks the engine-lock/reinjection timing
  assumption.
- A root user can intentionally install rules that cut off remote administration.
  The TUI requires confirmation for `BlockAll`, but root remains authoritative.
- Rules owned by other products may still drop traffic that OpenShield returns
  or accepts. The nftables backend never flushes tables it does not own; the
  compatibility backend uses `--noflush` and owns only `OPENSHIELD_*` chains,
  but inserts dispatch jumps first in built-in IPv4/IPv6 chains.
- Fixed backend paths are checked as root-owned, safely permissioned regular
  executables before later path-based spawns. A privileged package update or
  root process can replace one between validation and execution. This path
  TOCTOU is inside the already trusted UID-0/package-management boundary.
- Learning creates application-and-endpoint rules, not trust in remote content.
  A learned server or local executable can later become malicious, so learned
  entries should be reviewed. Any attributable local process can deliberately
  contact many endpoints and consume its 256-rule application quota or a
  filesystem UID's 512-rule quota. Distributed activity can still consume the
  7,500-rule learned capacity or 8 MiB state quota during a Learning window.
  The 2,500-slot manual reserve is count-only. These limits preserve bounds but
  can cause learning to pause and do not remove rule-poisoning risk.
- Root can still consume the complete 10,000-rule count through privileged
  manual mutations. This is inside the administrative trust boundary but can
  cause an operator-created availability limit.
- Competing privileged firewall managers can delete or reorder OpenShield
  objects. The daemon attempts to repair detected divergence, but arbitrary
  concurrent privileged editors are unsupported.
- A privileged `flush chain` leaves the base chain's default-drop policy in
  place, so it cannot create a fail-open path, but lightweight health checks do
  not reconstruct missing allow rules until a later policy apply or restart.
- Health monitoring checks table, base-chain, policy, and named-counter metadata,
  not complete rule bodies. A privileged targeted edit or additional allow rule
  can therefore evade detection. Such a `CAP_NET_ADMIN` peer is outside the
  unprivileged threat boundary and must not run concurrently.
  On nftables, the three checks are requested from one fixed `nft` process and
  parsed as ordered, bounded JSON documents. This reduces process-launch cost
  but retains the same one-second cadence, validation coverage, and fail-closed
  repair behavior; it does not strengthen the trust boundary against root.
- Strict inbound filtering can block required ICMPv6 neighbour/router discovery.
  Version 0.1 has no ICMP type/code selector; operators must scope explicit
  ICMPv6 allows by link-local network and interface where possible. Application
  attribution supports only echo requests for ICMP/ICMPv6.
- The `inet` table covers host IPv4/IPv6, not layer-2 ARP or direct frame
  injection by a privileged `AF_PACKET`/`CAP_NET_RAW` peer. OpenShield 0.1 is
  not an L2 firewall.
- If both a state transaction and emergency-state persistence fail, the daemon
  keeps kernel `BlockAll` active and enters read-only quarantine instead of
  restarting from an ambiguous file. Recovery then requires a local root
  operator to repair storage and deliberately replace or move aside the state
  file before restarting.
